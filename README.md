# Alien_Invasion

This was a small project I worked on over the summer of 2019 as I was self learning python. The materials and code used for this project 
are found in the textbook "Python Crash Course - A Hands-On, Project Based Introduction to Programming" by Eric Matthes.

## Descripton:
Alien invasion is a basic 2D arcade-style shooter in which the player's goal is to get as high of a score as possible by shooting the
fleet of aliens on-screen. The aliens will move side-to-side and towards the player, with increasing speed on each level. The player will
have three lives to score as many points as possible.

## How to run:
Note: In order for the program to work, Pyame must be installed. You can download Pygame at https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted.

1. After downloading the files from this repository, open the Command Prompt/Terminal.
2. Go into the directory in which all of the python files are located.
3. Run the command 'python alien_invasion.py' to start the game.

## Game Controls:
- Left/right arrow keys to move
- Space to shoot bullets
- Press 'q' to quit the game
